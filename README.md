# Development of a tool to project and compare mean sea level variability between two recording stations

## Project Introduction
Global mean sea level has risen about 8-9 inches since 1880 as a result of global warming according to the NOAA (2019). With these changing conditions comes a new challenge for most countries around the world which is staying afloat. These rising sea levels threaten a vast number of lives as 8 out of 10 major cities around the world are found near a coast. These rising sea levels also cause destruction in the form of storm surges such as Hurricane Katrina and “Superstorm” Sandy.

Being able to predict sea level changes seems to still be a challenge for the scientific world today. While long-term global changes can be mapped out it’s impacts on each individual region should be closely monitored to help save lives of people living in coastal areas. Predicting these changes would help countries gain a preview of what is to be expected and help them better prepare resources for land management. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Adminstration (NOAA) detects mean sea level changes in recording stations around the world. These mean sea level datasets should be analysed as this can generate a predictive analysis which we aim to do which will give us a better idea on what changes are set to come. With the knowledge of mean sea level changes, we can be better prepared for the looming effects of climate change by allocating resources more efficiently to prepare for this change.

This project aims to create a tool that performs graphical data analysis, data quality checking, summarizes descriptive statistics and performs ARIMA forecasting for two recording stations from the NOAA website as chosen by the user.
